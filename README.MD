## Test 2:

1. HTML: Build the basic structure of the application using HTML, including sections for displaying location, current weather information (temperature, conditions, icons), and potentially a forecast section.
2. CSS: Style the application using CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This could involve using layouts (flexbox or grid), typography, colors, and basic animations (optional).
3. Responsiveness: Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

JavaScript (Basic):

1. Implement functionality to fetch weather data from a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Use JavaScript to dynamically update the application with the retrieved weather information (temperature, conditions, icons).
3. Consider error handling for situations where the API call fails.
